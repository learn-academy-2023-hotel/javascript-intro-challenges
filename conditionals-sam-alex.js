// Write the code that will log true or false for the following:

// Is 34 divided by 3 greater than 67 divided by 2?

sadCake = (34 / 3)
happyCake = (67 / 2)
console.log(sadCake > happyCake)

// Does 5 evaluate to the same as "5"?

console.log(5 == "5")

// Does 5 strictly equal "5"?

console.log(5 === "5")

// Does !3 strictly equal 3?

console.log(!3 === 3)

// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 AND "Student".length strictly equal 7?

console.log("LEARN".length === 5 && "Student".length === 7)
